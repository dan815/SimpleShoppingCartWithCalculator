#SimpleShoppingCartWithCalculator


## Getting Started
This is a Checkout Project that I've created.
There is very basic functionality to add items to a basket. Item's equals and hashcode method were overridden for ease of access.
There is PriceCalculator util class that is making use of Stream API.
Please note that this requires JRE 1.8 compliance to run.

To test functionality please navigate to src/test/java/PriceCalculatorTest and run this file.
